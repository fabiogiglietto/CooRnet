## Overview
Given a set of URLs, this package detects coordinated link sharing behavior (CLSB) and outputs the network of entities that performed such behavior.

## What do we mean by coordinated link sharing behavior?
CLSB refers to a specific coordinated activity performed by a network of Facebook pages, groups and verified public profiles (Facebook public entities) that repeatedly shared the same news articles in a very short time from each other.

To identify such networks, we designed, implemented and tested an algorithm that detects sets of Facebook public entities which performed CLSB by (1) estimating a time threshold that identifies URLs shares performed by multiple distinguished entities within an unusually short period of time (as compared to the entire dataset), and (2) grouping the entities that repeatedly shared the same news story within this coordination interval. The rationale is that, while it may be common that several entities share the same URLs, it is unlikely, unless a consistent coordination exists, that this occurs within the time threshold and repeatedly.

See also <A HREF="#References">references</A> for a more detailed description and real-world applications.

## Installation
You can install CooRnet from GitHub.

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fabiogiglietto/CooRnet")
```
## API keys
### CrowdTangle (required)
This package requires a <A HREF="https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API">CrowdTangle API</A> key entry in your R environment file. The R environment file is loaded every time R is started/restarted.

The following steps show how to add the key to your R environment file.

1) Open your .Renviron file. The file is usually located in your home directory. If the file does not exist, just create one and name it .Renviron.
2) Add a new line and enter your API key in the following format: CROWDTANGLE_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>.
3) Save the file and restart your current R session to start using CooRnet.

### NewsGuard (optional)
Optionally, you can also set your credential to access NewsGuard API. The integration returns the average <A HREF="https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/rating-process-criteria/">NewsGuard rating score</A> obtained by the domains shared by a coordinated network.

This process requires an active subscription to <A HREF="https://www.newsguardtech.com">NewsGuard API</A> and key entries in your R environment file. The R environment file is loaded every time R is started/restarted.

The following steps show how to add the key to your R environment file.

1) Open your .Renviron file. The file is usually located in your home directory. If the file does not exist, just create one and name it .Renviron.

2) Add two new line and enter your API key in the following format:

NG_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"NG_SECRET = "YOUR_API_SECRET"

3) Save the file and restart your current R session to start using CooRnet.

## Usage
CooRnet requires a list of urls with respective publication date. Such list can be collected from various sources including CrowdTangle itself (e.g. Historical Data with a link post type filter), Twitter APIs (filtering for tweets with a url) and GDELT.

In this example, we use <A HREF="https://github.com/jandix/mediacloudr">mediacloudr</A>, an API Wrapper for the mediacloud.org API, to retrieve our initial list of news stories. Alternatively, is it also possible to use a CSV file exported from <A HREF="https://explorer.mediacloud.org/#/home">MediaCloud Explorer</A>.

``` r
library("mediacloudr")

# add API key to your R environment file.
# Open your .Renviron file. The file is usually located in your home directory. If the file does not exist, just create one and name it .Renviron.
# Add a new line and enter your API key in the following format: MEDIACLOUD_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>.
# Save the file and restart your current R session to start using mediacloudr.

df <- get_story_list(rows = 100,
                           fq = "(text:coronavirus OR text:'covid-19' OR text:'SARS-CoV-2') AND (tags_id_media:186572515 OR tags_id_media:186572435 OR tags_id_media:186572516 OR tags_id_media:162546808 OR tags_id_media:162546809) AND publish_date:[2020-03-02T00:00:00.000Z TO 2020-04-03T00:00:00.000Z]")

# Alternative using a file exported from MediaCloud Explorer and uploaded into r
# df <- readr::read_csv("rawdata/MediaCloud_output.csv") # file exported from MediaCloud

library("CooRnet")

# get public shares of MediaCloud URLs on Facebook and Instagram (assumes a valid CROWDTANGLE_API_KEY in Env).
ct_shares.df <- get_ctshares(df, url_column = "url", date_column = "publish_date", platforms = "facebook,instagram", sleep_time = 1, nmax = 100, clean_urls = TRUE)

# get coordinated shares and networks
output <- get_coord_shares(ct_shares.df = ct_shares.df)

# creates the output objects in the environment
# 1. ct_shares_marked.df: a dataframe that contains all the retrieved social media shares plus an extra boolean variable (is_coordinated) that identify if the shares was coordinated.
# 2. highly_connected_g: igraph graph of coordinated networks of pages/groups/accounts
# 3. highly_connected_coordinated_entities: a dataframe that lists coordinated entities and corresponding component
get_outputs(output)

# save highly_connected_coordinated_entities in .CSV format for further analysis
write.csv(highly_connected_coordinated_entities, file = "highly_connected_coordinated_entities.csv")

# save highly_connected_g in .GRAPHML format for further analysis with Gephi or similar softwares
igraph::write.graph(highly_connected_g, file = "highly_connected_g.graphml", format = "graphml")

```

## Advanced Usage
CooRnet also features additional functions that streamlines the analysis of coordinated networks.

### Component Summary
get_component_summary creates an handy aggregated views of network properties including:

1) the proportion of coordinated shares over the total shares (coorshare_ratio)
2) the average coordinated score (avg_cooRscore)
3) a measure of dispersion (gini) in the distribution of domains coordinatedly shared by the component (0-1)
4) the top 5 coordinatedly shared domains (ranked by n. of shares)
5) the total number coordinatedly shared of domains

Usage is simple:

``` r
comp_summary <- get_component_summary(output)

# save comp_summary in .CSV format for further analysis
write.csv(comp_summary, file = "comp_summary.csv")

```

### Top URLs
get_top_coord_urls creates a ranked list of best performing URLs shared by coordinated networks. URLs can be sorted by various criteria including "engagement" wich is a sum of comments, shares and reactions (likes and other reactions) gathered by that URL.

You can customize the behaviour of get_top_coord_urls by specifing that you want a rank of URLs per componenent (top URLs for each network) or not and specify the number of URLs you want the function to return.

``` r
top_urls_per_components <- get_top_coord_urls(output, order_by = "engagement", component = TRUE, top = 10)

top_urls_all <- get_top_coord_urls(output, order_by = "engagement", component = FALSE, top = 10)

# save top_urls_per_components in .CSV format for further analysis
write.csv(top_urls_per_components, file = "top_urls_per_components.csv")

# save top_urls_all in .CSV format for further analysis
write.csv(top_urls_all, file = "top_urls_all.csv")

```

### Top Shares
get_top_coord_shares creates a ranked list of best performing posts with link (shares) published by coordinated networks. Shares can be sorted by various criteria including "engagement" wich is of comments, shares and reactions (likes and other reactions) gathered by that post.

You can customize the behaviour of get_top_coord_shares by specifing that you want a rank of URLs per componenent (top shares for each network) or not and specify the number of URLs you want the function to return.

``` r
top_shares_per_components <- get_top_coord_shares(output, order_by = "engagement", component = TRUE, top = 10)

top_shares_all <- get_top_coord_shares(output, order_by = "engagement", component = FALSE, top = 10)

# save top_shares_per_components in .CSV format for further analysis
write.csv(top_shares_per_components, file = "top_shares_per_components.csv")

# save top_shares_all in .CSV format for further analysis
write.csv(top_shares_all, file = "top_shares_all.csv")

```

#' get_component_summary
#'
#' A function to get summary data by coordinated component
#'
#' @param output the output list resulting from the function get_coord_shares
#'
#' @return A data frame containing summary data by each coordinated component:
#' the average subscribers number of entities in a component,
#' the proportion of coordinated shares over the total shares (coorshare_ratio), the average coordinated score (avg_cooRscore),
#' a measure of dispersion (gini) in the distribution of domains coordinatedly shared by the component (0-1). Higher values correspond to an higher concentration (less different domains linked),
#' the top 5 coordinatedly shared domains (ranked by n. of shares),
#' the total number coordinatedly shared of domains
#'
#'
#' @details The gini values are computed by using the Gini coefficient on the proportions of unique domains each component shared. The Gini coefficient is a measure of the degree of concentration (inequality) of a variable in a distribution.
#' It ranges between 0 and 1: the more nearly equal the distribution, the lower its Gini index. When a component shared just one domain, the value of the variable is set to 1. It is calculated separately for full_domains (e.g. www.foxnews.com, video.foxnews.com) and parent domains (foxnews.com)
#'
#' The cooRscore.avg is a measures of component coordination. Higher values implies higher coordination.
#' Its value is calculated by dividing, for each entity in a coordinated network, its \code{\link[igraph]{strength}} by its \code{\link[igraph]{degree}}, and then calculating the average by component of these values.
#'
#' The cooRshare_ratio.avg is an addional measure of component coordination ranging from 0 (no shares coordinated) to 1 (all shares coordinated).

get_cluster_summary(
  output,
  mongo_url = NULL,
  mongo_database = NULL,
  mongo_cluster = TRUE,
  newsguard_info = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{the output list resulting from the function get_coord_shares}

\item{mongo_url}{string: address of the MongoDB server in standard URI Format. Set to NULL to avoid using mongo (default NULL)}

\item{mongo_database}{string: name of the MongoDB database where the shares have been saved. Set to NULL to avoid using mongo (default NULL)}

\item{mongo_cluster}{logical: set to TRUE if you are using a MongoDB cluster instead of standalone instance (default FALSE)}

\item{newsguard_info}{logical: set to TRUE to get NewsGuard rating for domains shared by the culster NewsGuard credentials required (default FALSE)}
}
\value{
A data frame containing summary data by each coordinated cluster:
the average subscribers number of entities in a cluster,
the proportion of coordinated shares over the total shares (coorshare_ratio), the average coordinated score (avg_cooRscore),
a measure of dispersion (gini) in the distribution of domains coordinatedly shared by the cluster (0-1). Higher values correspond to an higher concentration (less different domains linked),
the top 5 coordinatedly shared domains (ranked by n. of shares),
the total number coordinatedly shared of domains
}
\description{
A function to get summary data by coordinated cluster
}
\details{
The gini values are computed by using the Gini coefficient on the proportions of unique domains each cluster shared. The Gini coefficient is a measure of the degree of concentration (inequality) of a variable in a distribution.
It ranges between 0 and 1: the more nearly equal the distribution, the lower its Gini index. When a cluster shared just one domain, the value of the variable is set to 1. It is calculated separately for full_domains (e.g. www.foxnews.com, video.foxnews.com) and parent domains (foxnews.com)

The cooRscore.avg is a measures of cluster coordination. Higher values implies higher coordination.
Its value is calculated by dividing, for each entity in a coordinated network, its \code{\link[igraph]{strength}} by its \code{\link[igraph]{degree}}, and then calculating the average by cluster of these values.

The cooRshare_ratio.avg is an addional measure of cluster coordination ranging from 0 (no shares coordinated) to 1 (all shares coordinated).

  # get the top ten posts containing URLs shared by each network cluster and by engagement
  cluster_summary <- get_cluster_summary(output)

  # clustering the clusters rowwise mutate
  clusters <- hclust(dist(cluster_summary[, 2:4]))
  plot(clusters)

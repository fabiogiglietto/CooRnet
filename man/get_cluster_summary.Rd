\usage{
get_cluster_summary(output, labels = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{the output list resulting from the function get_coord_shares}

\item{labels}{auto-generate a cluster label using account's title and descriptions. Relies on Openai APIs. Expects the API Bearer in OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing summary data by each coordinated cluster:
the average subscribers number of entities in a cluster,
the proportion of coordinated shares over the total shares (coorshare_ratio), the average coordinated score (avg_cooRscore),
a measure of dispersion (gini) in the distribution of domains coordinatedly shared by the cluster (0-1). Higher values correspond to an higher concentration (less different domains linked),
the top 5 coordinatedly shared domains (ranked by n. of shares),
the total number coordinatedly shared of domains
}
\description{
A function to get summary data by coordinated cluster
}
\details{
The gini values are computed by using the Gini coefficient on the proportions of unique domains each cluster shared. The Gini coefficient is a measure of the degree of concentration (inequality) of a variable in a distribution.
It ranges between 0 and 1: the more nearly equal the distribution, the lower its Gini index. When a cluster shared just one domain, the value of the variable is set to 1. It is calculated separately for full_domains (e.g. www.foxnews.com, video.foxnews.com) and parent domains (foxnews.com)

The cooRscore.avg is a measures of cluster coordination. Higher values implies higher coordination.
Its value is calculated by dividing, for each entity in a coordinated network, its \code{\link[igraph]{strength}} by its \code{\link[igraph]{degree}}, and then calculating the average by cluster of these values.

The cooRshare_ratio.avg is an addional measure of cluster coordination ranging from 0 (no shares coordinated) to 1 (all shares coordinated).

  # get the top ten posts containing URLs shared by each network cluster and by engagement

  # clustering the clusters rowwise mutate

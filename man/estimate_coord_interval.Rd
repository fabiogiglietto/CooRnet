\usage{
estimate_coord_interval(
  ct_shares.df,
  q = 0.1,
  p = 0.5,
  clean_urls = FALSE,
  keep_ourl_only = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct_shares.df}{the data.frame of link posts resulting from the function get_ctshares}

\item{q}{parameter that controls the quantile of quickest URLs to be filtered. Default to 0.1 [0-1]}

\item{p}{parameter that controls the percentage of total shares to be reached. Default to 0.5 [0-1]}

\item{clean_urls}{clean up unnecessary url paramters and malformed urls, and keep just the URLs included in the original data set (default FALSE)}

\item{keep_ourl_only}{restrict the analysis to ct shares links matching the original URLs (default=FALSE)}
}
\value{
a list containing two objects: summary statistics of q\% quickest second share performing URLs, and a time in seconds corresponding to the median time spent by these URLs to cumulate the p\% of their total shares
}
\description{
This function estimates a threshold in seconds that defines a coordinated link share. While it is common that multiple (pages/groups/account) entities share the same link, some tend to perform these actions in an unusually short period of time. Unusual is thus defined here as a function of the median co-share time difference. More specifically, the function ranks all co-shares by time-difference from first share and focuses on the behaviour of the quickest second share performing q\% (default 0.5) URLs. The value returned is the median time in seconds spent by these URLs to cumulate the p\% (default 0.1) of their total shares

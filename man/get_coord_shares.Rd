\usage{
get_coord_shares(
  ct_shares.df,
  coordination_interval = NULL,
  parallel = FALSE,
  percentile_edge_weight = 0.9,
  clean_urls = FALSE,
  keep_ourl_only = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ct_shares.df}{the data.frame of link posts resulting from the function get_ctshares}

\item{coordination_interval}{a threshold in seconds that defines a coordinated share. Given a dataset of CrowdTangle shares, this threshold is automatically estimated by the estimate_coord_interval interval function. Alternatively it can be manually passed to the function in seconds}

\item{parallel}{enables parallel processing to speed up the process taking advantage of multiple cores (default FALSE). The number of cores is automatically set to all the available cores minus one}

\item{percentile_edge_weight}{defines the percentile of the edge distribution to keep in order to identify a network of coordinated entities. In other terms, this value determines the minimum number of times that two entities had to coordinate in order to be considered part of a network. (default 0.90)}

\item{clean_urls}{clean the URLs from the tracking parameters (default FALSE)}

\item{keep_ourl_only}{restrict the analysis to ct shares links matching the original URLs (default=FALSE)}
}
\value{
A list (results_list) containing four objects: 1. The input data.table (ct_shares.dt) of shares with an additional boolean variable (coordinated) that identifies coordinated shares, 2. An igraph graph (highly_connected_g) with networks of coordinated entities whose edges also contains a t_coord_share attribute (vector) reporting the timestamps of every time the edge was detected as coordinated sharing, 3. A dataframe with a list of coordinated entities (highly_connected_coordinated_entities) with respective name (the account url), number of shares performed, average subscriber count, platform, account name, if the account name changed, if the account is verified, account handle, degree and component number
}
\description{
Given a dataset of CrowdTangle shares and a time threshold, this function detects networks of entities (pages, accounts and groups) that performed coordinated link sharing behavior

\examples{
output <- get_coord_shares(ct_shares.df)

output <- get_coord_shares(ct_shares.df = ct_shares.df, coordination_interval = coordination.interval, percentile_edge_weight=0.9, clean_urls=FALSE, keep_ourl_only=FALSE)

# Extract the outputs
get_outputs(output)

# Save the data frame of CrowdTangle shares marked with the â€œiscoordinatedâ€ column
write.csv(ct_shares_marked.df, file=â€œct_shares_marked.df.csvâ€)

# Save the graph in a Gephi readable format
library(igraph)
write.graph(highly_connected_g, file="highly_connected_g.graphml", format = "graphml")

# Save the data frame with the information about the highly connected coordinated entities
write.csv(highly_connected_coordinated_entities, file=â€œhighly_connected_coordinated_entities.csvâ€)
